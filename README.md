# Languages of Babel

A massively multiplayer language-learning RPG. Master any language by exploring an AI-powered fantasy world where every conversation, quest, and battle teaches you real linguistic skills.

## Vision

Language apps are boring. Games are addictive. We combined them.

Languages of Babel is a full MMORPG where the core progression mechanic is language acquisition. Players explore Babel City, interact with AI NPCs, complete quests, fight monsters, and cooperate with other learners—all while genuinely mastering languages from Spanish to Sumerian to Sindarin.

## Game Structure

### Progression System
- **Outer City Districts**: Tutorial zone, basic vocabulary and grammar
- **Inner City**: Intermediate proficiency, unlock trade skills and advanced NPCs
- **The Tower**: Expert challenges, ancient and fictional languages
- **Heaven's Gate**: Mastery achievements, polyglot status

### Core Mechanics
- **NPC Conversations**: AI-driven dialogue in target languages with context-aware hints
- **Combat System**: Cast spells using correct grammar structures, command party members in target language
- **Quest System**: Missions requiring reading comprehension, listening skills, translation challenges
- **Economy**: Buy items, trade with players, manage inventory—all using target language
- **Co-op Multiplayer**: Form parties, raid dungeons, communicate in-game only in target languages
- **Skill Trees**: Unlock abilities by mastering grammar concepts, vocabulary tiers, pronunciation

### Language Catalog
- **Modern**: 50+ living languages (Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, etc.)
- **Ancient**: Classical languages (Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, Classical Chinese)
- **Forgotten**: Dead languages (Akkadian, Sumerian, Old Norse, Gothic, Coptic)
- **Fictional**: Constructed languages (Elvish, Klingon, Dothraki, Na'vi, High Valyrian)

## Technology Stack

### AI Integration
- **NPC Intelligence**: LLM-powered conversations that adapt to learner level
- **Dynamic Content**: AI generates quests, dialogue, and scenarios based on learning progress
- **Image Generation**: Visual content for items, characters, environments
- **Voice Synthesis**: Natural pronunciation for all languages
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Real-time adjustment based on player performance

### Architecture (Planned)
- Frontend: React/Next.js or Godot (decision pending)
- Backend: Node.js/Python with WebSocket support for multiplayer
- Database: PostgreSQL for user data, MongoDB for dynamic content
- AI: OpenAI API, local LLMs for cost optimization, Stable Diffusion for images
- Audio: ElevenLabs or Coqui TTS for voice

## Unique Features

- **Subliminal Learning**: History, theology, philosophy woven into quests and lore
- **Zero Paywalls**: Completely free, ad-free, open-source
- **Infinite Customization**: Modding support, custom quest creation, user-generated content
- **Real Linguistic Theory**: Based on SLA research, spaced repetition, comprehensible input
- **Social Learning**: Guilds, language exchange, peer tutoring systems
- **Competitive Modes**: PvP spelling battles, speed translation arenas, leaderboards

## Current Status

**Phase**: Concept & Architecture Planning

We're currently designing core systems and seeking contributors with expertise in:
- Game development (Unity/Godot/Unreal)
- Backend/multiplayer architecture
- LLM/AI integration
- Linguistics/language pedagogy
- UI/UX for educational games
- 3D modeling and animation

## Contributing

This is an insanely ambitious project. We need builders who want to revolutionize how humans learn languages.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` (coming soon) for guidelines.

## Philosophy

Learning languages shouldn't feel like work. It should feel like the best game you've ever played—except when you stop playing, you've actually learned Mandarin, or Ancient Greek, or Klingon.

The Tower of Babel scattered humanity and confused our languages. We're building a place where that confusion becomes connection.
